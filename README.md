## 📱 Usage Example

```
🗣️ User: "My dog has been vomiting twice today and seems lethargic"

🤖 Assistant: "I understand you're concerned about your dog. Let me assess 
              the situation. Can you tell me:
              1. How old is your dog?
              2. What did they eat in the last 24 hours?
              3. Are they drinking water?"

🗣️ User: "She's 3 years old, ate normal kibble, and yes, drinking water"

🤖 Assistant: "Based on the symptoms - vomiting twice with lethargy in a 
              3-year-old dog who's still drinking - this requires veterinary 
              attention within 12 hours. I'm scheduling an appointment with 
              your regular vet. In the meantime:
              • Withhold food for 6-8 hours
              • Continue offering small amounts of water
              • Monitor for increased vomiting or diarrhea
              
              🚨 Call emergency vet immediately if: severe lethargy, 
              blood in vomit, or stops drinking water."
